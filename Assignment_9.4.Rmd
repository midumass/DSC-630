## Binomial Distribution

Given the formula below, one can predict the likelihood of an event occurring given the probability of success (or failure, as 1-success), number of attempts (if the attempts are independent), and the number of attempts resulting in a success.

We can use this to find the probability (or p-value) of each circumstance below, then subtract that value from 1 to find the probability in question.

#### 1. The ensemble contains 11 independent models, all of which have an error rate of 0.2.
```{r}
p1 <- dbinom(11, size = 11, prob = .8)
```

With a p-value of `r p1`, there is a `r round((1 - p1) * 100, 2)`% chance of an incorrect prediction being made. 



#### 2. The ensemble contains 11 independent models, all of which have an error rate of 0.49.
```{r}
p2 <- dbinom(11, size = 11, p = .51)
```

With a p-value of `r p2`, there is a `r round((1 - p2) * 100, 2)`% chance of an incorrect prediction being made. 

#### 3. The ensemble contains 21 independent models, all of which have an error rate of 0.49.
```{r}
p3 <- dbinom(21, size = 21, p = .51)
```

With a p-value of `r p3`, there is a `r round((1 - p3) * 100, 2)`% chance of an incorrect prediction being made. Of course there is never really a 100% chance, but theres only a `r p3`% chance of all predictions being correct.
